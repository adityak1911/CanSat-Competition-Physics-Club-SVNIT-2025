##  Step 1: Install Arduino IDE

1. Visit the official Arduino software page:  
   ðŸ‘‰ [https://www.arduino.cc/en/software](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
2. Download the **Windows Installer (64-bit)**.
3. Run the downloaded `.exe` file.
4. During installation, **allow all prompts** and **install everything**, including bundled drivers.

##  Step 2: Install Silicon Labs CP210x Drivers

Some boards use the **CP210x USB-to-UART** bridge chip.  

1. Open the official Silicon Labs driver page:  
   ðŸ‘‰ [https://www.silabs.com/software-and-tools/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers?tab=downloads](https://www.silabs.com/software-and-tools/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers?tab=downloads)
2. Scroll down to **Downloads** and choose the **Windows (64-bit)** VCP driver.
3. Extract the ZIP file after download.
4. Run the installer (e.g., `CP210xVCPInstaller_x64.exe`).
5. **Allow all system prompts** and let the installation finish.
6. Once installed, your CP210x-based board will appear as a COM port.

##  Step 3: Install CH340/CH341 Drivers

Other boards may use the **CH340/CH341** USB-to-UART chip.  

1. Download the driver from:  
   ðŸ‘‰ [https://sparks.gogo.co.nz/ch340.html](https://sparks.gogo.co.nz/ch340.html)
2. Scroll down and download the **Windows CH340 driver package**.
3. Extract the ZIP archive.
4. Run the installer (e.g., `SETUP_64.EXE`).
5. **Allow all installation prompts** and let it complete.
6. After installation, CH340-based boards will show up as a COM port in Device Manager.

##  Final Steps & Verification

1. Connect your ESP32/Arduino board via USB.
2. Open **Device Manager** â†’ under **Ports (COM & LPT)** check:
   - `Silicon Labs CP210x USB to UART Bridge (COMx)` for CP210x boards.
   - `USB-SERIAL CH340 (COMx)` for CH340 boards.
3. Open the **Arduino IDE** â†’ go to **Tools â†’ Port** â†’ select the correct COM port.
4. Upload the **Blink** sketch to confirm everything works.

##  Troubleshooting

- If the driver doesnâ€™t install automatically, go to **Device Manager**, right-click the unknown device â†’ **Update driver** â†’ **Browse my computer for drivers**, then select the extracted driver folder.
- Always **allow Windows security prompts** when installing.
