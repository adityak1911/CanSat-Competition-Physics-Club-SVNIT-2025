# ESP32 with LoRa (SX1276/78) Receiver

This project demonstrates how to interface a **LoRa module (SX1276/SX1278)** with an **ESP32** using SPI communication.  
The ESP32 will act as a **LoRa receiver**, listening for packets sent by another LoRa transmitter.

## üì¶ Library Installation

To use the LoRa module with ESP32, install the **LoRa library by Sandeep Mistry**:

1. Open **Arduino IDE**  
2. Go to **Sketch ‚Üí Include Library ‚Üí Manage Libraries**  
3. Search for **LoRa**  
4. Install **LoRa by Sandeep Mistry**

## üöÄ Upload Code

1. Connect your ESP32 to the computer  
2. Open the Arduino IDE and paste the code from `lora_rx_test.ino`  
3. Select **Board: ESP32 Dev Module** and the correct **COM port**  
4. Upload the code  
5. Open the **Serial Monitor** at `115200 baud` to see received packets

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- Ensure your LoRa module is **3.3V compatible** (SX1276/78 typically is).  
- Attach an **antenna** to the LoRa module for proper operation.  
- Both transmitter and receiver must use the **same frequency** (e.g., 433 MHz, 868 MHz, or 915 MHz depending on your region).
